As 2020 has progressed, more social issues have come to public attention. With the surge of activism from the Black Lives Matter movement, people have been using this momentum to raise awareness to these many issues ranging from systemic racism within the United States to the horrors of the fast fashion industry. I want this website to serve as a compilation of many of these matters that have been brought up in 2020. Using social media posts, blogs, and news articles, I plan to organize some of the political and social issues that I have seen and want to share. This project was highly inspired by Instagram accounts such as @soyouwanttotalkabout and @shityoushouldcareabout.
